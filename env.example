# AdSense Ifrit - Local Configuration
# This file documents the configuration options, but Ifrit 
# primarily uses user-provided settings from the Settings modal.

# ============================================
# OPTIONAL - For Development/Testing Only
# ============================================

# These are OPTIONAL overrides. In normal usage, users provide
# their own keys via the Settings modal (stored in localStorage).

# If you want to skip the Settings modal during development:
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_test_key_here

# ============================================
# NOTE: This is a LOCALHOST app
# ============================================
# Ifrit runs locally as a content generation tool.
# The generated content (articles) will be published to the 
# user's own blog, which has its own domain.
#
# Users configure their blog URL in the Settings modal, not here.
