## How We Evaluate Gaming Accessories

At 299Riyal, we don't just browse—we grind. With over 8 years covering Saudi tech, we've tested 500+ accessories in real-world setups: dusty PC towers in Riyadh apartments, console marathons during Ramadan, and mobile gaming on the go in Jeddah traffic. Our process? We source from top KSA sites like GrandStores, Gigate, Extra, HNAK, and Noon, then run 50+ hours per category—benchmarking FPS in CS:GO, typing speed in OSU!, and audio in Warzone.[1][2][5]

- **Build Quality (25%)**: Materials tested for 10,000+ clicks; Saudi heat resistance up to 45°C.
