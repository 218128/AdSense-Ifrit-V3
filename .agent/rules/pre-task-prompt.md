Before implementing [TASK], you MUST:

1. TRACE: Show me the execution path of a WORKING similar feature
   - File → Function → External Call → API Route
   
2. COMPARE: Show how my task will follow the SAME pattern
   - If pattern differs, explain why and get my approval
   
3. VERIFY: After implementation, run the actual feature in browser
   - Show me the console output or screenshot
   - Don't mark complete until you verify it works

Do NOT proceed to implementation until steps 1-2 are shown to me.
