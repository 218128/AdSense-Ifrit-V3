# Guide to Buying Refurbished: Noon Renewed vs. Amazon Renewed

Buying a brand new flagship phone in 2025 is expensive. An iPhone 15 Pro can easily cost 4,500 SAR. But what if you could get the same phone, with a warranty, for 3,000 SAR?

Enter the world of "Refurbished" (or "Renewed") tech.

In Saudi Arabia, the two biggest players are **Noon Renewed** and **Amazon Renewed**. Both promise "like-new" devices, but they operate differently. This guide breaks down exactly what you get from each, so you don't end up with a scratched-up lemon.

## What Does "Renewed" Actually Mean?

A renewed device isn't just "used." It has (supposedly) been inspected, tested, and cleaned by professionals.
*   **Battery:** Should be at least 80% capacity.
*   **Screen:** No visible scratches when held at arm's length.
*   **Accessories:** Might come with generic charging cables (no original box).

## Noon Renewed: The Local Giant

Noon has invested heavily in its refurbished program. They often source devices from their own "Trade-in" programs here in KSA.

### Pros
*   **Faster Shipping:** Since the stock is often in Riyadh or Dubai, you get it in 24 hours.
*   **Easy Returns:** You can drop off returns at Noon lockers found in many Saudi cities.
*   **Specific Grading:** Noon is very clear about "Excellent" vs "Good" condition.

### Cons
*   **Packaging:** Often comes in a plain brown "Noon" box, which isn't great for gifting.
*   **Stock:** Popular items sell out extremely fast.

## Amazon Renewed: The Global Standard

Amazon's program is rigorous. Sellers have to meet strict performance criteria to even list refurbished items.

### Pros
*   **The 90-Day Guarantee:** Amazon offers a 90-day replacement or refund guarantee if the device doesn't work as expected. This is peace of mind.
*   **Professional Inspection:** Items are inspected by Amazon-qualified suppliers.
*   **Variety:** You can find obscure tech (laptops, cameras) that Noon might not carry.

### Cons
*   **International Shipping:** Some renewed items ship from the US or UK, taking longer to arrive.
*   **Cosmetics:** "Acceptable" condition on Amazon can sometimes be quite rough (visible dings).

## Grading Systems Explained

Since we can't use tables, here is how the grades generally break down:

**Grade A (Excellent / Premium)**
*   **Screen:** Perfect. No scratches.
*   **Body:** flawless or micro-scratches invisible from 30cm away.
*   **Battery:** 90-100% health.
*   **Price:** Highest (Save ~15-20% off new).

**Grade B (Very Good)**
*   **Screen:** May have light micro-scratches.
*   **Body:** Visible scratches or small dents on the casing.
*   **Battery:** 80-90% health.
*   **Price:** Mid-range (Save ~30% off new).

**Grade C (Good / Acceptable)**
*   **Screen:** Likely has visible scratches.
*   **Body:** Noticeable dents, wear on charging port.
*   **Battery:** Guaranteed minimum 80%.
*   **Price:** Lowest (Save ~40-50% off new).

## Expert Tip: The Battery Lottery

The biggest risk with refurbished phones is the battery health.
*   **Advice:** As soon as you open the box, check the battery health settings. If it is below 80%, return it immediately. Do not accept it.

## Conclusion

If you want speed and easy local returns, **Noon Renewed** is excellent for Riyadh/Jeddah residents.
If you want the best buyer protection and warranty, **Amazon Renewed**'s 90-day guarantee is unbeatable.
