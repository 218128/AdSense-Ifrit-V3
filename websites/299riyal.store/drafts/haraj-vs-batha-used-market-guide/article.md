# Haraj vs. Batha: Where to Find the Best Used Tech Deals

If you want to buy a used iPhone, a PlayStation 5, or a laptop in Saudi Arabia, you have two main battlegrounds: The **Haraj App** (Online) and the **Batha/Mursalat Markets** (Physical).

Both have amazing deals, but the rules of the game are different.

## 1. The Haraj App (Online)
The largest marketplace in the Kingdom. it is purely peer-to-peer (person to person).

**Pros:**
*   **Direct from Owners:** You are buying from the person who used the phone, not a reseller heavily marking up the price.
*   **Convenience:** Browse while lying on your sofa.
*   **Variety:** You can find rare items, car parts, and furniture all in one place.

**Cons:**
*   **Scams:** "Transfer me 50 SAR for delivery" is a common scam. NEVER transfer money before seeing the item.
*   **Logistics:** You have to arrange a time to meet the seller, usually in a gas station parking lot.

## 2. Batha / Mursalat (Physical Markets)
The beating heart of Riyadh's electronics trade. Hundreds of small shops packed together.

**Pros:**
*   **Immediate Inspection:** You can hold the phone, check the camera, and test the screen before paying.
*   **Haggling:** The price is never fixed. You can negotiate hard.
*   **Warranty:** Many shops offer a "7-day shop warranty" for used items, which is safer than buying from a random person on Haraj.

**Cons:**
*   **Parking:** Finding parking in Batha is a nightmare.
*   **Heat:** Walking between shops in summer is exhausting.
*   **Refurbished Risks:** Ideally, check if the phone was opened or repaired. Shops are experts at hiding this; random sellers on Haraj might be more honest (or simpler).

## The Verdict

*   **Go to Haraj If:** You look for a specific item (e.g., "iPhone 13 Mini Blue 256GB") and have patience to filter through ads.
*   **Go to Batha If:** You have cash in hand, want a phone TODAY, and are good at negotiating face-to-face.

**Expert Tip:** Use Haraj to check the market price *before* you go to Batha. If Haraj average is 1000 SAR, and the shop asks 1300 SAR, show them the ads on your phone to lower the price!
