# Essential Car Gadgets for Saudi Drivers (Heat Resistant)

Driving in Saudi Arabia presents a unique challenge: The Heat.
Leaving a regular plastic phone mount or a cheap battery-powered dashcam in your car in July is a recipe for disaster. The plastic melts, and the batteries swell.

To build the ultimate "Saudi-Proof" car setup, you need gadgets designed to withstand extreme temperatures. Here are our top picks under 200 SAR.

## 1. The Dashcam: 70mai Smart Dash Cam 1S
**Approx. Price:** 169 SAR

A dashcam is essential for navigating the traffic of Riyadh or Jeddah. The 70mai 1S is the most popular budget choice for a reason.

*   **Why it works here:** While it has a small battery, it has a high-temperature protection mechanism that shuts it down if it gets dangerously hot.
*   **Resolution:** 1080p Full HD (Crisp enough to read license plates).
*   **Voice Control:** "Take Picture" command works offline.

## 2. The Phone Mount: UGREEN Gravity Car Phone Holder
**Approx. Price:** 45 SAR

Avoid sticky suction cups! The sun will melt the adhesive, and your phone will fall on the dashboard.
Instead, use an **Air Vent Mount** like the UGREEN Gravity.
*   **Mechanism:** It uses the weight of the phone to lock it in place.
*   **Safety:** Since it sits on the AC vent, your phone is actively cooled by the air conditioning while you drive.

## 3. The Charger: Anker PowerDrive 2 Alloy
**Approx. Price:** 59 SAR

Plastic chargers feel cheap and can warp. The Anker PowerDrive 2 Alloy is made of solid metal. It dissipates heat much better than plastic alternatives.
*   **Power:** 24W Dual USB output.
*   **Size:** flush fit, barely sticks out of the cigarette lighter socket.

## 4. The Bluetooth Aux Adapter: Baseus BA01
**Approx. Price:** 25 SAR

Driving an older Camry or Yukon without Bluetooth? Don't replace the whole stereo. The Baseus adapter plugs into your AUX port and USB port (for power) and instantly gives you crystal clear wireless audio.
*   **Durability:** The coiled cable design resists tangling and heat damage.

## 5. Tire Pressure Monitor (TPMS) caps
**Approx. Price:** 80-120 SAR

Hot asphalt expands the air in your tires, increasing the risk of blowouts on highways like the Riyadh-Dammam expwy. External TPMS caps screw onto your tire valves and send real-time pressure data to a small solar-powered display on your dash.
*   **Safety:** Alerts you immediately if pressure gets too high or too low.

## Expert Advice: Supercapacitors vs. Batteries

When buying a dashcam for Saudi Arabia, always look for the word **"Supercapacitor"** (or Capacitor).
*   **Batteries:** Swell and explode in 70°C heat.
*   **Capacitors:** Can easily withstand 80°C+ without failing. They hold just enough power to save the file when the car turns off.
*   **Recommendation:** If you can stretch your budget to 300 SAR, the **VIOFO A119** uses capacitors and is the gold standard for heat.

## Conclusion

Don't buy cheap gas station accessories—they will melt. Stick to metal-bodied chargers (Anker) and vent-mounted holders to keep your tech safe and cool. Safe driving!
