# Best Bluetooth Speakers for Kashta and Camping

Winter in Saudi Arabia means one thing: *Kashta* (Camping).
Whether you are heading to the red sands of Thumamah or the edges of the Empty Quarter, music is essential. But the desert is unforgiving. Sand gets everywhere, and if you are near the coast, humidity is a killer.

You need a speaker that is dustproof, waterproof, and loud enough to be heard over the wind (and the generator). Here are the best "Kashta-Certified" speakers under 300 SAR.

## 1. JBL Go 3: The Pocket Rocket
**Approx. Price:** 169 SAR

Don't let the size fool you. The JBL Go 3 has surprisingly punchy bass. Its fabric design looks great and provides grip.
*   ** ruggedness:** IP67 Dust and Water resistant. You can drop it in the sand, rinse it off with water, and it keeps playing.
*   **Loop:** Has a built-in loop to hang it from your tent pole or backpack.
*   **Battery:** 5 hours (Look for a power bank if you stay overnight).

## 2. Anker Soundcore 3: The Battery King
**Approx. Price:** 229 SAR

If your camping trip lasts all weekend, you need Anker. The Soundcore 3 offers a massive 24-hour battery life.
*   **Sound:** Stereo sound with titanium drivers for clear vocals (great for listening to podcasts or Oud music).
*   **PartyCast:** You can link 100+ Soundcore speakers together to create a massive sound system in the desert.

## 3. Sony SRS-XB13: Deep Bass
**Approx. Price:** 199 SAR

Sony's "Extra Bass" technology really works here. It projects sound upwards, which is great when everyone is sitting in a circle on the ground.
*   **Durability:** UV coating helps it resist sun damage.
*   **Mic:** Has a built-in mic for hands-free calls.

## 4. Tribit StormBox Micro 2: The Clip-On
**Approx. Price:** 249 SAR

A favorite of hikers in Abha. It has a built-in rubber strap on the back that lets you strap it tightly to a bike, a tent pole, or your wrist.
*   **Feature:** It works as a power bank! You can charge your phone *from* the speaker in an emergency.

## Summary

*   **For Day Trips:** JBL Go 3.
*   **For Weekend Camping:** Anker Soundcore 3.
*   **For Bass Lovers:** Sony SRS-XB13.

Enjoy the desert, and remember to leave no trace behind!
