# Affordable Gaming Accessories Under 200 SAR

Building a gaming setup in Saudi Arabia doesn't mean you have to drop 5,000 SAR on peripherals alone. While brands like Razer and Logitech have their place, the budget gaming market has evolved tremendously. You honestly don't need to spend more than 200 SAR to get a satisfying "clicky" mechanical keyboard, a precise mouse, or a comfortable headset.

Whether you're grinding in *Valorant*, dropping into *Fortnite*, or exploring Riyadh in *MW3*, here is your guide to building a killer setup on a budget.

## The Budget Gamer's Starter Pack

| Gear Type | Top Recommendation | Approx. Price | Why We Love It |
|-----------|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Keyboard** | Redragon K552 Kumara | 145 SAR | Real mechanical switches, tank-like build |
| **Mouse** | Logitech G102 Lightsync | 89 SAR | Best sensor in its class |
| **Headset** | HyperX Cloud Stinger Core | 139 SAR | Lightweight comfort |
| **Mousepad** | SteelSeries QcK Mini | 35 SAR | Smooth glide |

## 1. The Keyboard: Redragon K552 Kumara
This is widely considered the king of budget mechanical keyboards. It’s compact (TKL design), meaning it gives you more room for mouse movement—crucial for FPS games.
- **Switches:** Comes with custom mechanical switches (cherry blue equivalent) that are loud, clicky, and satisfying.
- **Build:** Metal and ABS construction makes it feel indestructible.
- **RGB:** Yes, it has red LED backlighting (or RGB depending on the specific model variation in Jarir).

## 2. The Mouse: Logitech G102 Lightsync
Don't let the low price fool you. The G102 uses a sensor that is incredibly accurate. It’s a favorite among eSports pros who want a simple, lightweight shape.
- **DPI:** Adjustable up to 8000 DPI.
- **Style:** Features fully customizable RGB lighting via the Logitech G Hub software.

## 3. The Headset: HyperX Cloud Stinger Core
Audio is half the experience. The Stinger Core is designed for console and PC gamers who want comfort. It’s lightweight, so it won't hurt your neck after a 6-hour gaming marathon during the weekend.
- **Mic:** Noise-canceling microphone that mutes when you flip it up.

## 4. The "Hidden Gem" Combo: Aula F2088
If you browse through Noon or Amazon.sa, you'll often see "Combos" (Keyboard + Mouse). The Aula F2088 is a mechanical keyboard that often comes bundled with a decent mouse for around 150 SAR total. It features a cool retro "typewriter" keycap design and a magnetic wrist rest.

## What to Avoid
When shopping for budget gear in markets like Batha or online:
- **"Fake" Mechanical Keyboards:** Watch out for "Mem-chanical" or "Mechanical Feel." These are just rubber dome keyboards disguised as mechanical. Always check if it says "Blue/Red/Brown Switch."
- **Generic "Gamer" Brands:** Avoid unbranded plastic mice with 10 buttons that rattle. Stick to known budget kings like Redragon, Aula, or entry-level Logitech.

## Where to Buy
- **Soft Land (Riyadh):** A great spot for specifically PC gaming parts and peripherals.
- **Jarir Bookstore:** Good for Logitech and HyperX, but wait for their weekly flyers for the best prices.
- **Amazon.sa:** Usually has the widest stock of Redragon gear.

## FAQ

### Blue vs. Red Switches: Which should I get?
- **Blue Switches:** Loud and clicky. Great for typing, but might annoy your family if you game late at night.
- **Red Switches:** Linear and quiet. Better for fast-paced gaming and silent operations.

### Do these work with PS5 and Xbox?
Yes, most USB keyboards and mice work on consoles for supported games (like Call of Duty or Fortnite). The headsets connect via the 3.5mm jack on your controller.

### Why is a mousepad important?
Using a mouse directly on a wooden desk wears down the mouse feet and ruins your aim. Even a cheap 20 SAR cloth pad makes a huge difference.

## Conclusion
You don't need a sponsorship to play like a pro. With a setup involving the **Redragon K552** and the **Logitech G102**, you're getting 90% of the performance of high-end gear for 20% of the price. Good luck, and have fun!
