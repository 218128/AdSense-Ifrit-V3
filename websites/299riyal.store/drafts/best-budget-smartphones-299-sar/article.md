## Buying Guide: What to Look for Under 299 SAR

When shopping in this price bracket, you must manage your expectations. Here are the critical factors to prioritize:

1. **RAM:** Aim for at least 3GB. Devices with 2GB RAM may struggle with modern app updates.
2. **Battery:** Most budget phones come with 5000mAh. This is non-negotiable for a good experience.
3. **Storage:** 64GB is the sweet spot. If you get a 32GB model, ensure it has a dedicated microSD slot.
4. **Display:** Expect HD+ resolution. It won't be as sharp as a 4K screen, but it's perfectly fine for YouTube and social media.

## Expert Tip: Where to Buy in Saudi Arabia

To get the best deals under 299 SAR, keep an eye on:
- **Noon & Amazon.sa:** Frequently offer flash sales and "One Day Deals".
- **Jarir Bookstore:** Great for bundled offers and warranty support.
- **Extra:** Check their "Final Clearance" sections for older models that still perform well.

## Conclusion
