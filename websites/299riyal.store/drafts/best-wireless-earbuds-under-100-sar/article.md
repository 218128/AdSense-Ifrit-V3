Whether you're looking for earbuds for your daily commute in the Riyadh Metro, for focusing at the office, or for your evening gym session, this guide covers the best value-for-money options available right now in Saudi Arabia.

## 1. Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active: The Reliable Choice
Xiaomi is a master of the budget segment. The Redmi Buds 4 Active features large 12mm drivers that deliver surprisingly punchy bass. They also support Google Fast Pair, making them incredibly easy to connect to any Android phone.

- **Battery:** 5 hours on a single charge + 23 hours in the case.
- **Top Feature:** Noise cancellation for calls (ENC).

## 2. QCY T13: The Audiophile's Budget Pick
QCY might not be a household name like Samsung, but they are legendary in the earbud community. The T13 comes with an app that allows you to customize the EQ settings, something rarely seen at this price point.

- **Battery:** Exceptional 30-hour total battery life.
- **Fast Charging:** 5 minutes of charging gives you 1 hour of playback.

## 3. Lenovo LP40 Pro: The Pocket-Friendly Giant
If you're on an extremely tight budget, the Lenovo LP40 Pro is often available for under 50 SAR on Noon or Amazon.sa during sales. It’s small, lightweight, and gets the job done for podcasts and casual music listening.

- **Design:** Very compact, fits easily into the small pocket of your jeans.
- **Connectivity:** Uses the latest Bluetooth 5.1 for a stable connection.

## 4. Soundcore by Anker P20i: The Best App Support
Soundcore (by Anker) is famous for its durability. The P20i offers a robust build and an excellent app with 22 preset EQs. If you like heavy bass for your workouts, the "BassUp" mode is a game-changer.

- **Water Resistance:** IPX5 rating makes them sweat-proof.
- **Control:** Fully customizable touch controls.

## What to Expect (and what to skip) for 100 SAR

When buying earbuds in this range, keep these things in mind:

- **What you get:** Reliable Bluetooth connection, decent sound quality for the price, and touch controls.
- **What you DON'T get:** Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)—you'll mostly get ENC for calls. Don't expect "transparency mode" or wireless charging for the case.
- **Fit:** Most come with silicone tips. If you have small ears, check if the box includes different sizes (most do).

## Pro Tip: Where to Shop
For the best prices on earbuds in Saudi Arabia, **Noon** and **Amazon.sa** are usually cheaper than physical stores. However, if you're in Riyadh, the electronics shops in **Al-Olaya** or **Batha** often have even lower cash prices if you're willing to negotiate.

## FAQ

### Can I use one earbud at a time?
Yes, all the models listed above support "Mono Mode," allowing you to use either the left or right earbud while the other stays in the case.

### Are these good for gaming?
They are fine for casual games, but for competitive games like PUBG, you might notice a very slight delay (latency). Look for "Game Mode" in the QCY or Soundcore apps to minimize this.

### How do I clean them?
Wipe them with a dry cloth after each use, especially after the gym. Avoid using water directly on the earbuds.

## Conclusion
You don't need to spend 1,000 SAR on AirPods to enjoy your favorite music. The brands mentioned above offer incredible value that fits perfectly into a budget-conscious lifestyle in Saudi Arabia. If we had to pick one, the **Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active** is the most balanced choice for 2025.
