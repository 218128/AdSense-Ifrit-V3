# Cheapest Laptops and Chromebooks for Students in KSA

University life in Saudi Arabia is moving online. From submitting assignments on Blackboard to attending virtual classes, a smartphone just isn't enough anymore. But laptops are expensive.

If you are on a tight budget (under 1,000 SAR), you have two choices: A budget Windows laptop or a Chromebook. Here is what you need to know.

## Option 1: The Chromebook (Best for Speed)
Chromebooks run Google's ChromeOS. They are incredibly fast because they don't have all the bloat of Windows.
*   **Best for:** Writing papers, browsing the web, watching YouTube, and using Google Classroom.
*   **Worst for:** Gaming or installing specialized software like Photoshop or AutoCAD.

### Top Pick: Acer Chromebook 314
**Approx. Price:** 799 SAR (Jarir/Extra)
*   **Battery:** 12+ hours. Leave the charger at home.
*   **Screen:** 14-inch Anti-glare (great for bright lecture halls).
*   **Speed:** Boots up in 6 seconds.

## Option 2: Budget Windows Laptops (Best for Compatibility)
If you absolutely need Microsoft Office (Word/Excel) installed locally, or need to run specific Windows EXE files, you need a Windows machine. At this price point, they will be slower than Chromebooks.

### Top Pick: Asus Vivobook Go 15
**Approx. Price:** 999 - 1,100 SAR
*   **Screen:** 15.6-inch Screen (Good for multitasking).
*   **Storage:** usually comes with 128GB SSD (Avoid eMMC storage if possible).
*   **Portability:** Surprisingly thin and light.

## 3. The "Refurbished Business Laptop" Trick
Go to Haraj Computer in Olaya (Riyadh) or Khalidiyah St (Jeddah). You can find used **Dell Latitude** or **Lenovo ThinkPad** corporate laptops for around 800 SAR.
*   **Why do this?** These laptops cost 4,000 SAR when new. They are built like tanks and are much faster than new budget laptops.
*   **Check:** Ensure the battery is good and the screen has no dead pixels.

## Conclusion
*   If you live in the browser (Chrome, Docs, Netflix): Buy the **Acer Chromebook**.
*   If you need Windows for University software: Buy a used **ThinkPad** or a new **Asus Vivobook**.
