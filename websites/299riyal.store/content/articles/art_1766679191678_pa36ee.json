Accessory costs add up.\n*   **Samsung:** Wide range of price points. Mid-range offers fantastic features for the money. Flagships are competitive.

AI-powered features for photo and video editing will be highly advanced.\n\n### Software Ecosystem & User Experience\n\n*   **iOS (iPhone):** Simple, intuitive, and highly secure. The tightly controlled ecosystem ensures smooth performance and consistent app quality. Integration with other Apple devices is seamless.\n*   **Android (Samsung):** Highly customizable and open.

(Source: General tech market trends, consult local KSA classifieds for specific data)\n*   **Samsung:** While flagship Samsung phones hold their value better than lower-tier Androids, they generally depreciate faster than iPhones. However, the initial lower purchase price can offset some of this.\n\n> \"Investing in an iPhone often means a smaller financial hit when it's time to trade up. For many in Saudi Arabia, where upgrades are frequent, this effectively lowers the 'true' cost of ownership.\"\n\n### After-Sales Service & Warranty in KSA\n\nBoth brands have strong presences in Saudi Arabia.\n*   **Apple:** Authorized service centers (e.g., iStyle, A.R.C. – Arab Computers) provide reliable support and genuine parts.
