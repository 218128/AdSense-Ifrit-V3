In fact, the budget wearable market in Saudi Arabia has exploded with high-quality options that offer fitness tracking, notifications, and incredible 10+ day battery life—all without breaking the bank.\n\nWhether you're looking for your first smartwatch, a gift for a student, or a rugged companion for gym sessions, we've rounded up the absolute best smartwatches you can buy for under 299 SAR.\n\n## Quick Picks: Top 3 at a Glance\n\n| Feature | **Xiaomi Redmi Watch 3 Active** | **Huawei Band 9** | **Amazfit Bip 3 Pro** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Best For** | Overall Value | Sleep & Comfort | Outdoor Runners (GPS) |\n| **Display** | 1.83\" LCD | 1.47\" AMOLED | 1.69\" LCD |\n| **Battery** | 12 Days | 14 Days | 14 Days |\n| **Waterproof** | 5ATM | 5ATM | 5ATM |\n| **Approx. Price** | **149 SAR** | **199 SAR** | **249 SAR** |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Xiaomi Redmi Watch 3 Active\n**The Best Overall Budget Smartwatch**\n\n*Approximate Price: 149 SAR*\n\nThe **Redmi Watch 3 Active** is our top recommendation for most users. It strikes the perfect balance between design, screen real estate, and functionality. It looks and feels much more expensive than its price tag suggests.\n\n### Key Features\n*   **Large 1.83\" Display:** The screen is massive, making it easy to read WhatsApp notifications, check your heart rate, or control music while driving.\n*   **Bluetooth Calling:** Yes, at this price point! You can take phone calls directly from your wrist, a feature usually reserved for 500+ SAR watches.\n*   **Fitness Tracking:** Supports over 100 sports modes, including running, cycling, and weightlifting.\n*   **Premium Finish:** The metallic finish on the case gives it a sleek, modern look that fits both gym wear and office attire.\n\n### Pros & Cons\n**Pros:**\n*   Excellent battery life (up to 12 days).\n*   Bluetooth calling works surprisingly well.\n*   Very responsive UI.\n*   Works seamlessly with both Android and iPhone (via Mi Fitness app).\n\n**Cons:**\n*   Screen is LCD, not AMOLED (blacks aren't perfect).\n*   No built-in GPS (relies on phone GPS).\n\n**Verdict:** If you have 150 SAR to spend, buy this. It offers 90% of what casual users need from a smartwatch.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Huawei Band 9\n**Best for Health Tracking & Sleep**\n\n*Approximate Price: 199 SAR*\n\nWhile technically a \"fitness tracker\" form factor, the **Huawei Band 9** is powerful enough to be your main smartwatch. Huawei is renowned for its health sensor accuracy, often beating competitors twice the price in scientific tests.\n\n### Key Features\n*   **TruSleep™ 4.0:** Huawei's sleep tracking is industry-leading. It detects deep sleep, REM, and even breathing irregularities during the night.\n*   **AMOLED Display:** Unlike the Redmi, this uses an AMOLED panel. Colors pop, blacks are deep, and it's readable even under the harsh Riyadh sun.\n*   **Ultra-Thin Design:** At just 8.99mm thick and 14g weight, you'll forget you're wearing it. Perfect for 24/7 wear.\n*   **Health:** Pulse Wave Arrhythmia Analysis alerts you to irregular heartbeats.\n\n### Pros & Cons\n**Pros:**\n*   Stunning AMOLED display.\n*   Most accurate sleep and heart rate tracking in this class.\n*   Fast charging (full day use in 5 mins charge).\n*   Automatic workout detection.\n\n**Cons:**\n*   Narrow screen can make reading long messages tricky.\n*   No built-in GPS.\n\n**Verdict:** Choose this if health metrics and sleep quality are your priority. It's a health lab on your wrist.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Amazfit Bip 3 Pro\n**Best for Runners (Built-in GPS)**\n\n*Approximate Price: 249 SAR*\n\nFor runners and cyclists, carrying a heavy phone is annoying. The **Amazfit Bip 3 Pro** solves this by including **built-in GPS**. This means it maps your route independently without needing your phone nearby.\n\n### Key Features\n*   **4-Satellite Positioning System:** Connects to GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and QZSS for accurate route tracking.\n*   **Huge 1.69\" Screen:** Easy to see your pace and distance at a glance while running.\n*   **OxygenBeats™:** Tracks blood-oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) quickly.\n*   **2-Week Battery:** Even with GPS use, the battery management is excellent.\n\n### Pros & Cons\n**Pros:**\n*   Real built-in GPS (very rare under 300 SAR).\n*   Zepp App is fantastic for data analysis.\n*   60+ Sports modes.\n*   50m Water resistance (Swimming supported).\n\n**Cons:**\n*   Plastic build feels a bit cheaper than the Redmi.\n*   Display resolution is lower than Huawei.\n\n**Verdict:** The only choice under 300 SAR for serious runners who want to leave their phone at home.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Haylou RS4 Plus\n**Best Display Quality**\n\n*Approximate Price: 220 SAR*\n\nHaylou is a sub-brand of the Xiaomi ecosystem, and the **RS4 Plus** is their masterpiece. Its claim to fame is the \"Retina-grade\" AMOLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate.\n\n### Key Features\n*   **1.78\" AMOLED:** The colors are vibrant and sharp (368x448 resolution).\n*   **60Hz Refresh Rate:** Most budget watches run at 30Hz or lower, looking choppy. The RS4 Plus is buttery smooth, feeling like an Apple Watch.\n*   **Magnetic Strap:** Comes with a comfortable magnetic loop strap that fits any wrist size perfectly.\n\n**Verdict:** Buy it if you want the best-looking screen. It feels incredibly premium to touch and swipe.\n\n---\n\n## Buying Guide: How to Choose a Budget Smartwatch\n\nWith so many options, how do you decide? Here are the 4 key factors to consider before buying in Saudi Arabia:\n\n### 1. Compatibility\n*   **Android Users:** Almost all watches work perfectly.\n*   **iPhone Users:** Look for brands with good iOS apps like **Huawei**, **Xiaomi**, and **Amazfit**. Avoid specialized Android-only watches (like Galaxy Watch 4/5/6) as they won't work with iOS. All watches on our list work with iPhone.\n\n### 2. Display: AMOLED vs. LCD\n*   **AMOLED (Huawei, Haylou):** Better colors, battery friendly (black pixels turn off), better visibility in sun.\n*   **LCD (Redmi, Amazfit):** Cheaper, but backlighting is always on, making blacks look dark grey.\n*   *Tip:* If you want \"Always On Display\" (AOD), you usually need an AMOLED screen.\n\n### 3. Battery Life\nDon't settle for 1-day battery life (looking at you, Apple). Budget smartwatches should last **at least 7-10 days** on a single charge. All our picks offer 10+ days typical use.\n\n### 4. Arabic Language Support\nMost global versions sold in Saudi Arabia (Jarir, Extra, Noon, Amazon SA) support Arabic notifications perfectly. However, be careful with \"CN Version\" (China Version) imports from AliExpress, as they often require manual firmware updates to show Arabic text correctly. **Always check for \"Global Version\".**\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Can I answer calls on these watches?\nOnly the **Xiaomi Redmi Watch 3 Active** on this list supports Bluetooth calling (microphone + speaker). The others allow you to *reject* calls or see who is calling, but you cannot talk through the watch.\n\n### Are they accurate for steps and calories?\nYes, within a 90-95% margin of accuracy compared to medical-grade equipment. For casual fitness tracking, they are excellent. If you need 100% precision for professional training, look at Garmin (prices start at 1000+ SAR).\n\n### Do they have NFC for payment (Mada Pay)?\nNo. Unfortunately, NFC payment support is very rare in smartwatches under 299 SAR. You typically need to spend 600+ SAR (Samsung, Apple, or specific Garmin models) to get reliable NFC payment support in Saudi Arabia.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou don't need to spend thousands to get a smart companion on your wrist.\n\n*   **For the Best Value:** Get the **[Xiaomi Redmi Watch 3 Active](#)**. It has calling, a big screen, and looks great.\n*   **For Health & Sleep:** Get the **[Huawei Band 9](#)**. It’s light, accurate, and has a beautiful AMOLED screen.\n*   **For Running:** Get the **[Amazfit Bip 3 Pro](#)**. The GPS is a game-changer for outdoor cardio.\n\n*Disclaimer: Prices mentioned are approximate market rates in Saudi Arabia and may vary by retailer and promotions.*\n",
