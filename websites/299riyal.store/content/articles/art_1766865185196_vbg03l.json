  "content": "# Cheapest Laptops and Chromebooks for Students in KSA\n\nUniversity life in Saudi Arabia is moving online. From submitting assignments on Blackboard to attending virtual classes, a smartphone just isn't enough anymore. But laptops are expensive.\n\nIf you are on a tight budget (under 1,000 SAR), you have two choices: A budget Windows laptop or a Chromebook. Here is what you need to know.\n\n![Saudi Student Using Laptop for Madrasati](/images/budget-laptops-chromebooks-students-ksa/images/img-001.png)\n\n## Option 1: The Chromebook (Best for Speed)\nChromebooks run Google's ChromeOS. They are incredibly fast because they don't have all the bloat of Windows.\n*   **Best for:** Writing papers, browsing the web, watching YouTube, and using Google Classroom.\n*   **Worst for:** Gaming or installing specialized software like Photoshop or AutoCAD.\n\n### Top Pick: Acer Chromebook 314\n**Approx. Price:** 799 SAR (Jarir/Extra)\n*   **Battery:** 12+ hours. Leave the charger at home.\n*   **Screen:** 14-inch Anti-glare (great for bright lecture halls).\n*   **Speed:** Boots up in 6 seconds.\n\n## Option 2: Budget Windows Laptops (Best for Compatibility)\nIf you absolutely need Microsoft Office (Word/Excel) installed locally, or need to run specific Windows EXE files, you need a Windows machine. At this price point, they will be slower than Chromebooks.\n\n### Top Pick: Asus Vivobook Go 15\n**Approx. Price:** 999 - 1,100 SAR\n*   **Screen:** 15.6-inch Screen (Good for multitasking).\n*   **Storage:** usually comes with 128GB SSD (Avoid eMMC storage if possible).\n*   **Portability:** Surprisingly thin and light.\n\n## 3. The \"Refurbished Business Laptop\" Trick\nGo to Haraj Computer in Olaya (Riyadh) or Khalidiyah St (Jeddah). You can find used **Dell Latitude** or **Lenovo ThinkPad** corporate laptops for around 800 SAR.\n*   **Why do this?** These laptops cost 4,000 SAR when new. They are built like tanks and are much faster than new budget laptops.\n*   **Check:** Ensure the battery is good and the screen has no dead pixels.\n\n## Conclusion\n*   If you live in the browser (Chrome, Docs, Netflix): Buy the **Acer Chromebook**.\n*   If you need Windows for University software: Buy a used **ThinkPad** or a new **Asus Vivobook**.",
