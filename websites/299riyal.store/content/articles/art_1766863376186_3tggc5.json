  "content": "# Best Bluetooth Speakers for Kashta and Camping\n\nWinter in Saudi Arabia means one thing: *Kashta* (Camping).\nWhether you are heading to the red sands of Thumamah or the edges of the Empty Quarter, music is essential. But the desert is unforgiving. Sand gets everywhere, and if you are near the coast, humidity is a killer.\n\nYou need a speaker that is dustproof, waterproof, and loud enough to be heard over the wind (and the generator). Here are the best \"Kashta-Certified\" speakers under 300 SAR.\n\n![Rugged Bluetooth Speaker in the Saudi Desert](/images/best-bluetooth-speakers-kashta-camping/images/img-001.png)\n\n## 1. JBL Go 3: The Pocket Rocket\n**Approx. Price:** 169 SAR\n\nDon't let the size fool you. The JBL Go 3 has surprisingly punchy bass. Its fabric design looks great and provides grip.\n*   ** ruggedness:** IP67 Dust and Water resistant. You can drop it in the sand, rinse it off with water, and it keeps playing.\n*   **Loop:** Has a built-in loop to hang it from your tent pole or backpack.\n*   **Battery:** 5 hours (Look for a power bank if you stay overnight).\n\n## 2.
