If you're hunching over a tiny screen and using a trackpad, you are destroying your posture and productivity.\n\nYou don't need a 5000 SAR Herman Miller chair to fix your setup. Small, affordable accessories can completely transform how you work. Here are the best upgrades under 299 SAR.\n\n## Quick Picks: Desk Essentials\n\n| Model | **Nexstand K2 / Generic Metal Stand** | **Anker PowerExpand+ 7-in-1** | **Logitech M350 Pebble** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Best For** | Posture / Neck Pain | Connectivity | Travel / Silence |\n| **Material** | Aluminum / Reinforced Nylon | Aluminum | Plastic |\n| **Ports** | N/A | HDMI, SD, USB-A, PD | N/A |\n| **Price** | **80 - 120 SAR** | **179 SAR** | **99 SAR** |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Aluminum Laptop Stand\n**The Neck Saver**\n\n*Approximate Price: 80 - 120 SAR*\n\nLooking down at a laptop screen puts nearly 60lbs of pressure on your neck. A simple stand raises the screen to eye level.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **Ergonomics:** Keeps your spine aligned. You'll feel the difference in your neck after just one day.\n*   **Cooling:** Aluminum acts as a heat sink, and the open design increases airflow, keeping your laptop fast.\n*   **Aesthetic:** Matches the silver finish of MacBooks and modern Windows laptops.\n\n### Expert Tip\nYou will need an external keyboard and mouse to use this comfortably, as typing on a raised laptop is awkward.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Anker PowerExpand+ 7-in-1 USB-C Hub\n**The Dongle You Need**\n\n*Approximate Price: 179 SAR*\n\nModern laptops only have USB-C ports. This hub gives you everything back.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **4K HDMI:** Connect to a monitor or TV for presentations.\n*   **Power Delivery:** Pass-through charging lets you charge your laptop while using the hub.\n*   **SD Card Reader:** Essential for photographers and creators.\n*   **Reliability:** Unlike cheap 50 SAR hubs that overheat and disconnect, Anker hubs last for years.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Logitech M350 Pebble Mouse\n**The Silent Traveler**\n\n*Approximate Price: 99 SAR*\n\nTrackpads are great for gestures, but terrible for precision work like Excel or Photoshop. The **Logitech Pebble** is the perfect companion.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **Silent Clicks:** It makes 90% less noise than a regular mouse. Use it in a library or coffee shop without annoying anyone.\n*   **Dual Connectivity:** Connect via Bluetooth or the stored USB receiver.\n*   **18-Month Battery:** Runs on a single AA battery forever.\n\n---\n\n## Buying Guide: Maximizing Productivity\n\n### 1. Vertical vs Flat Stands\n*   **Flat/Angled Stands:** Good for using the laptop keyboard (slightly).\n*   **Vertical Docks:** Saves space but requires external monitor + keyboard. Best for small desks.\n\n### 2. Hub Bandwidth\nCheap hubs limit USB speeds to 2.0 (slow). Make sure upgrading to **USB 3.0** (5Gbps) or higher like the Anker we recommended, especially if you move large files.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Do I need a mousepad?\nModern optical mice (like the Logitech Pebble) track on almost any surface, including glass and wood tables. You likely don't need a dedicated mousepad unless you are gaming.\n\n### Will a hub drain my battery?\nYes, a connected hub consumes a small amount of power even when not in use. It is best to unplug it when your laptop is sleeping in a bag.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n*   **For your health:** Buy a **[Laptop Stand](#)** immediately.\n*   **For connectivity:** The **[Anker 7-in-1 Hub](#)** is the only dongle you need.\n\n*Disclaimer: Prices are estimated market averages in KSA.*\n",
