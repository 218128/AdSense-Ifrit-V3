A simple fitness tracker can monitor your heart rate, sleep, and activity levels, helping you stay motivated and accountable.\n\nIn the past, cheap trackers were inaccurate toys. Today, for less than 200 SAR, you can get medical-grade sensors and displays that rival premium smartwatches. Here are the best affordable fitness trackers available in Saudi Arabia.\n\n## Quick Picks: Best Bands\n\n| Model | **Xiaomi Smart Band 9** | **Huawei Band 9** | **Honor Band 7** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Best For** | Overall Value | Sleep Accuracy | Style |\n| **Screen** | 1.62\" AMOLED | 1.47\" AMOLED | 1.47\" AMOLED |\n| **Refresh Rate** | 60Hz | 30Hz | 30Hz |\n| **Battery** | 16 Days | 14 Days | 14 Days |\n| **Price** | **169 SAR** | **199 SAR** | **149 SAR** |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Xiaomi Smart Band 9 (aka Band 8)\n**The King of Budget Trackers**\n\n*Approximate Price: 169 SAR*\n\nThe **Xiaomi Smart Band** series is the world's best-selling wearable for a reason. The latest iteration (often sold as Band 8 or 9 globally) brings a massive upgrade: a 60Hz refresh rate screen.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **Silky Smooth Screen:** The 60Hz display makes scrolling menus feel fast and fluid, unlike older choppy bands.\n*   **Versatile Wearing:** You can wear it on your wrist, clip it to your shoe (Pebble Mode) for running, or wear it as a necklace.\n*   **Bright Display:** 600 nits brightness means it's readable even at noon in Riyadh.\n\n### Expert Tip\nBuy the \"Running Clip\" accessory if you are a serious runner. It attaches the band to your laces to track stride length and ground contact time.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Huawei Band 9\n**The Sleep Specialist**\n\n*Approximate Price: 199 SAR*\n\nHuawei has invested millions into their health algorithms. The **Band 9** is less about flashiness and more about clinical accuracy.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **TruSleep™ 4.0:** It gives you a detailed breakdown of Light, Deep, and REM sleep, plus a \"Sleep Score\" every morning. It's shockingly accurate compared to a professional sleep stusdy.\n*   **Arrhythmia Analysis:** It can detect signs of A-fib (irregular heartbeat) using its PPG sensor.\n*   **Comfort:** The fluoroelastomer strap is soft and sweat-resistant, perfect for wearing to bed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Amazfit Band 7\n**The Battery Monster**\n\n*Approximate Price: 189 SAR*\n\nDo you hate charging? The **Amazfit Band 7** matches the others on features but beats them on endurance.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **18-Day Battery:** With typical use, it lasts nearly three weeks. With \"Battery Saver\" mode, it can go for a month.\n*   **Large Viewable Area:** The screen viewing area is 112% bigger than the previous Band 5.\n*   **Alexa Built-in:** You can set alarms and timers with your voice.\n\n---\n\n## Buying Guide: Fitness Band vs Smartwatch\n\nMany people ask: \"Why buy a band when I can get a smartwatch for the same price?\"\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nAt the 200 SAR price point, a **Fitness Band** (like Huawei Band 9) usually has **better sensors** than a cheap smartwatch. The money goes into the health tech, not the big case.\n\n### 2. Comfort\nBands are ultra-light (15-20g). You can sleep with them easily. Cheap smartwatches are often bulky and uncomfortable for sleep tracking.\n\n### 3. Battery\nBands generally last 14+ days. Smartwatches with big screens often last 5-7 days.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Do they count calories correctly?\nThey provide an *estimate* based on your heart rate and movement. They are consistent (good for tracking progress) but don't treat the number as medical fact.\n\n### Can I swim with these?\nYes! All bands on this list are **5ATM Water Resistant**, meaning they are safe for swimming in pools or ocean (up to 50 meters). They even have specific \"Pool Swimming\" modes to count your laps.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n*   **For the smoothest experience:** Get the **[Xiaomi Smart Band 9](#)**.\n*   **For sleep tracking:** Get the **[Huawei Band 9](#)**.\n\n*Disclaimer: Prices are estimated market averages in KSA.*\n",
