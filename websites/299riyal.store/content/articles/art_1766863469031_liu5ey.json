  "content": "# Guide to Buying Refurbished: Noon Renewed vs. Amazon Renewed\n\nBuying a brand new flagship phone in 2025 is expensive. An iPhone 15 Pro can easily cost 4,500 SAR. But what if you could get the same phone, with a warranty, for 3,000 SAR?\n\nEnter the world of \"Refurbished\" (or \"Renewed\") tech.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the two biggest players are **Noon Renewed** and **Amazon Renewed**. Both promise \"like-new\" devices, but they operate differently. This guide breaks down exactly what you get from each, so you don't end up with a scratched-up lemon.\n\n## What Does \"Renewed\" Actually Mean?\n\n![Refurbished Device Inspection](/images/buying-refurbished-tech-saudi-guide/images/img-001.png)\n\nA renewed device isn't just \"used.\" It has (supposedly) been inspected, tested, and cleaned by professionals.\n*   **Battery:** Should be at least 80% capacity.\n*   **Screen:** No visible scratches when held at arm's length.\n*   **Accessories:** Might come with generic charging cables (no original box).\n\n## Noon Renewed: The Local Giant\n\nNoon has invested heavily in its refurbished program. They often source devices from their own \"Trade-in\" programs here in KSA.\n\n### Pros\n*   **Faster Shipping:** Since the stock is often in Riyadh or Dubai, you get it in 24 hours.\n*   **Easy Returns:** You can drop off returns at Noon lockers found in many Saudi cities.\n*   **Specific Grading:** Noon is very clear about \"Excellent\" vs \"Good\" condition.\n\n### Cons\n*   **Packaging:** Often comes in a plain brown \"Noon\" box, which isn't great for gifting.\n*   **Stock:** Popular items sell out extremely fast.\n\n## Amazon Renewed: The Global Standard\n\nAmazon's program is rigorous. Sellers have to meet strict performance criteria to even list refurbished items.\n\n### Pros\n*   **The 90-Day Guarantee:** Amazon offers a 90-day replacement or refund guarantee if the device doesn't work as expected. This is peace of mind.\n*   **Professional Inspection:** Items are inspected by Amazon-qualified suppliers.\n*   **Variety:** You can find obscure tech (laptops, cameras) that Noon might not carry.\n\n### Cons\n*   **International Shipping:** Some renewed items ship from the US or UK, taking longer to arrive.\n*   **Cosmetics:** \"Acceptable\" condition on Amazon can sometimes be quite rough (visible dings).\n\n## Grading Systems Explained\n\nSince we can't use tables, here is how the grades generally break down:\n\n**Grade A (Excellent / Premium)**\n*   **Screen:** Perfect. No scratches.\n*   **Body:** flawless or micro-scratches invisible from 30cm away.\n*   **Battery:** 90-100% health.\n*   **Price:** Highest (Save ~15-20% off new).\n\n**Grade B (Very Good)**\n*   **Screen:** May have light micro-scratches.\n*   **Body:** Visible scratches or small dents on the casing.\n*   **Battery:** 80-90% health.\n*   **Price:** Mid-range (Save ~30% off new).\n\n**Grade C (Good / Acceptable)**\n*   **Screen:** Likely has visible scratches.\n*   **Body:** Noticeable dents, wear on charging port.\n*   **Battery:** Guaranteed minimum 80%.\n*   **Price:** Lowest (Save ~40-50% off new).\n\n## Expert Tip: The Battery Lottery\n\nThe biggest risk with refurbished phones is the battery health.\n*   **Advice:** As soon as you open the box, check the battery health settings. If it is below 80%, return it immediately. Do not accept it.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you want speed and easy local returns, **Noon Renewed** is excellent for Riyadh/Jeddah residents.\nIf you want the best buyer protection and warranty, **Amazon Renewed**'s 90-day guarantee is unbeatable.",
