Your car is your second home, and stock features often lack the convenience we need in 2025.\n\nWe've tested dozens of accessories to find the ones that actually survive the heat and deliver quick charging. Here are our top picks under 299 SAR.\n\n## Quick Picks: Must-Haves\n\n| Model | **Anker PowerDrive Speed+ 2** | **Baseus Magnetic Mount** | **70mai Dash Cam 1S** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Best For** | Fast Charging | Phone Stability | Safety / Evidence |\n| **Speed** | 30W (PD + IQ2) | N/A | 1080p Recording |\n| **Mount Type** | Cigarette Lighter | Adhesive / Vent | Windshield |\n| **Price** | **99 SAR** | **45 SAR** | **199 SAR** |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Anker PowerDrive Speed+ 2\n**The Charger That Saves Time**\n\n*Approximate Price: 99 SAR*\n\nMost car USB ports charge at a painfully slow 5W. The **Anker PowerDrive Speed+ 2** pumps out **30W** of power, enough to fast-charge a MacBook Air or bring an iPhone from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **Power Delivery (PD):** The dedicated USB-C port handles fast charging for modern phones.\n*   **Dual Charging:** Can charge a navigation phone and a passenger's tablet simultaneously without slowing down.\n*   **Heat Safety:** Anker’s MultiProtect system prevents overheating, crucial for summer driving.\n\n---\n\n## 2. 70mai Dash Cam 1S\n**The Cheapest High-Quality Insurance**\n\n*Approximate Price: 199 SAR*\n\nDash cams are becoming essential for proving fault in accidents. The **70mai 1S** (from the Xiaomi ecosystem) is reliable, discreet, and shoots clear 1080p video.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **Voice Control:** \"Take Picture\", \"Record Video\". Keep your hands on the wheel.\n*   **Loop Recording:** Automatically overwrites old footage so you never run out of space.\n*   **Night Vision:** Sony Starvis sensors ensure license plates are readable at night.\n\n### Expert Tip\nYou will need a high-endurance MicroSD card (sold separately ~40 SAR) because standard cards fail in the heat.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Baseus Magnetic Car Mount\n**Simple and Strong**\n\n*Approximate Price: 45 SAR*\n\nForget those flimsy plastic claws. Magnetic mounts are the way to go. Stick a small metal plate on your phone case, and it snaps onto the mount instantly.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **Strong Magnets:** Holds an iPhone 15 Pro Max securely even over speed bumps.\n*   **360 Rotation:** Easily spin your phone for map navigation.\n*   **Cable Management:** Includes clips to keep your charging cable tidy.\n\n---\n\n## Buying Guide: Surviving the Heat\n\n### 1. Dashboard vs Vent Mounts\n*   **Dashboard (Adhesive):** Better visibility, but the extreme Saudi heat (50°C+) can melt high-quality 3M adhesive over time.\n*   **Vent Mounts:** Keeps your phone cool (A/C blows on it), preventing your phone from overheating and dimming the screen during navigation. **We recommend Vent Mounts in summer.**\n\n### 2. Dash Cam Resolution\nDon't settle for 720p. You need **1080p minimum** to read license plates. 4K is nice but generates huge files that fill memory cards fast.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Will these chargers drain my car battery?\nQuality chargers (like Anker) stop drawing power when the car is off. However, some older cars keep the cigarette lighter active 24/7. In that case, unplug it when parking for long periods.\n\n### Are dash cams legal in KSA?\nYes, dash cams are widely used for safety and insurance purposes. However, **do not** use them to film people in private settings or post footage of others online without consent, as this violates privacy laws.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n*   **For fast charging:** Get the **[Anker PowerDrive Speed+ 2](#)**.\n*   **For safety:** Get the **[70mai Dash Cam 1S](#)**.\n\n*Disclaimer: Prices are estimated market averages in KSA.*\n",
