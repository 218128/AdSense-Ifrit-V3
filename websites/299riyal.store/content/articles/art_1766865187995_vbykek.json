  "content": "# Haraj vs. Batha: Where to Find the Best Used Tech Deals\n\nIf you are looking for the absolute lowest prices on electronics in Saudi Arabia, you have to leave the comfort of the air-conditioned malls. You need to head to the markets. But which one should you choose?\n\n![Busy Electronics Market in Batha, Riyadh](/images/haraj-vs-batha-used-market-guide/images/img-001.png)\n\n## Haraj: The Physical Bargain Hub\n\nBoth have amazing deals, but the rules of the game are different.\n\n## 1. The Haraj App (Online)\nThe largest marketplace in the Kingdom. it is purely peer-to-peer (person to person).\n\n**Pros:**\n*   **Direct from Owners:** You are buying from the person who used the phone, not a reseller heavily marking up the price.\n*   **Convenience:** Browse while lying on your sofa.\n*   **Variety:** You can find rare items, car parts, and furniture all in one place.\n\n**Cons:**\n*   **Scams:** \"Transfer me 50 SAR for delivery\" is a common scam. NEVER transfer money before seeing the item.\n*   **Logistics:** You have to arrange a time to meet the seller, usually in a gas station parking lot.\n\n## 2. Batha / Mursalat (Physical Markets)\nThe beating heart of Riyadh's electronics trade. Hundreds of small shops packed together.\n\n**Pros:**\n*   **Immediate Inspection:** You can hold the phone, check the camera, and test the screen before paying.\n*   **Haggling:** The price is never fixed. You can negotiate hard.\n*   **Warranty:** Many shops offer a \"7-day shop warranty\" for used items, which is safer than buying from a random person on Haraj.\n\n**Cons:**\n*   **Parking:** Finding parking in Batha is a nightmare.\n*   **Heat:** Walking between shops in summer is exhausting.\n*   **Refurbished Risks:** Ideally, check if the phone was opened or repaired. Shops are experts at hiding this; random sellers on Haraj might be more honest (or simpler).\n\n## The Verdict\n\n*   **Go to Haraj If:** You look for a specific item (e.g., \"iPhone 13 Mini Blue 256GB\") and have patience to filter through ads.\n*   **Go to Batha If:** You have cash in hand, want a phone TODAY, and are good at negotiating face-to-face.\n\n**Expert Tip:** Use Haraj to check the market price *before* you go to Batha. If Haraj average is 1000 SAR, and the shop asks 1300 SAR, show them the ads on your phone to lower the price!",
