  "content": "\n# Top 5 Bluetooth Speakers Under 299 SAR for 2025\n\nGreat audio doesn't have to cost thousands of Riyals. While brands like Bose and Sonos dominate the premium market, the budget sector has seen massive improvements in sound quality and battery life. Whether you want a speaker for your room, a small gathering, or outdoor adventures, there are some amazing options available in the Saudi market for under 299 SAR.\n\n## Quick Picks: Best for Every Need\n\n| Model | **JBL Go 3** | **Anker Soundcore 3** | **Sony SRS-XB13** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Best For** | Portability | Battery Life | Bass Lovers |\n| **Power** | 4.2W | 16W Stereo | 5W |\n| **Battery** | 5 Hours | 24 Hours | 16 Hours |\n| **Waterproof** | IP67 | IPX7 | IP67 |\n| **Price** | **169 SAR** | **249 SAR** | **199 SAR** |\n\n---\n\n## 1. JBL Go 3\n**The \"Clip-and-Go\" King**\n\n*Approximae Price: 169 SAR*\n\nThe **JBL Go 3** features a bold new style and surprisingly rich JBL Pro Sound. It’s so small that you can fit it in your pocket, yet the sound is loud enough to fill a small room.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **IP67 Waterproof & Dustproof:** This is a true outdoor speaker. Take it to the pool, the park, or even the shower. It can survive complete submersion in water.\n*   **Rugged Design:** The fabric-wrapped body is tough and durable. The integrated loop lets you hook it onto your backpack effortlessly.\n*   **Sound Signature:** Punchy bass for its size, with clear vocals.\n\n### Expert Tip\nThe battery lasts about 5 hours, which is its main weakness. Keep a power bank handy if you're out all day.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Anker Soundcore 3\n**Best Battery Life & Stereo Sound**\n\n*Approximate Price: 249 SAR*\n\nAnker's Soundcore line is legendary for value. The **Soundcore 3** upgrades the fan-favorite Soundcore 2 with better sound and titanium drivers. It is one of the few speakers in this price range offering true stereo sound (two dedicated drivers).\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **24-Hour Playtime:** You can listen to 480 songs on a single charge. It’s perfect for weekend camping trips where you don't have power.\n*   **BassUp Technology:** Anker’s proprietary tech boosts the low frequencies in real-time.\n*   **App Control:** Use the Soundcore App to customize the EQ settings—a feature rare in budget speakers.\n\n**Verdict:** If you hate charging your devices, this is the speaker for you.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sony SRS-XB13\n**Deep Bass in a Tiny Package**\n\n*Approximate Price: 199 SAR*\n\nSony's **Extra Bass** series is famous for a reason. The SRS-XB13 uses a passive radiator to punch well above its weight in the low-end frequencies.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **Multiway Strap:** The versatile strap lets you hang it from a tent pole, wrist, or backpack.\n*   **Sound Diffusion Processor:** Spreads sound in every direction, not just straight forward.\n*   **Hands-Free Calling:** Has a built-in mic for taking calls, which works surprisingly clearly.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tribit XSound Go\n**The Audiophile's Secret Budget Choice**\n\n*Approximate Price: 140 SAR*\n\nTribit is a lesser-known brand that audio enthusiasts swear by. The **XSound Go** offers balanced, clear sound that rivals much more expensive brands like Bose.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **Crystal Clear Highs:** If you listen to classical music, jazz, or podcasts, the clarity here is unmatched at this price.\n*   **100ft Bluetooth Range:** incredible connection stability.\n*   **Value:** It sounds like a 400 SAR speaker but costs less than 150.\n\n---\n\n## Buying Guide: What to Look For?\n\n### 1. Waterproofing (IP Ratings)\n*   **IPX4:** Splash proof (Rain requires caution).\n*   **IPX7/IP67:** Fully waterproof (Can be dunked in a pool).\n*   *Advice:* For Saudi outdoor use (pools/beaches), always aim for **IPX7** or higher.\n\n### 2. Watts (Volume)\n*   **Under 5W:** Good for personal listening (JBL Go 3).\n*   **10W - 20W:** Good for a small group or room (Soundcore 3).\n*   *Advice:* Don't expect \"party\" volume from a 3W speaker. You need at least 15W+ to be heard over a noisy crowd.\n\n### 3. Battery Life\nLook for at least **10 hours** if you plan to take it out of the house regularly. Bluetooth connection drains battery faster at max volume.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Can I connect two speakers together?\nYes! The **Anker Soundcore 3** (via PartyCast) and **Sony SRS-XB13** (Stereo Pair) allow you to connect two of the same model for true stereo sound or double volume.\n\n### Do they work with laptops?\nYes, any device with Bluetooth can connect. Some models also have an AUX input (3.5mm jack), though this feature is disappearing from newer models like the JBL Go 3.\n\n### Which is loudest?\nThe **Anker Soundcore 3** is the loudest on this list with its dual drivers and 16W output.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n*   **For pure portability:** Grab the **[JBL Go 3](#)**.\n*   **For all-day battery:** The **[Anker Soundcore 3](#)** is the unbeaten champion.\n*   **For bass lovers:** The **[Sony SRS-XB13](#)** delivers that thump you crave.\n\n*Disclaimer: Prices are estimated market averages in KSA.*\n",
