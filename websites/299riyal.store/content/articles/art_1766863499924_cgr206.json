  "content": "# Top 5 Smartwatches Under 299 SAR in Saudi Arabia (2025)\n\nSmartwatches have evolved from luxury items to essential daily companions. In Saudi Arabia, where we balance busy work lives with active evenings (especially in the cooler months), having notifications and health tracking on your wrist is a game changer.\n\nBut do you need to spend 1,500 SAR on a Galaxy Watch or Apple Watch SE? Not necessarily. The sub-300 SAR market is packed with devices that offer Bluetooth calling, AMOLED screens, and week-long battery life.\n\nHere are the best options you can buy right now in Riyadh, Jeddah, or Dammam.\n\n## The Comparison Criteria\n\nSince we are looking at budget devices, we prioritized:\n*   **Bluetooth Calling:** Can you answer calls while driving or praying?\n*   **Screen Quality:** Is it bright enough for the Saudi sun?\n*   **Battery Life:** Does it last at least 5 days?\n*   **Arabic Support:** Do notifications appear correctly right-to-left?\n\n\n![Smartwatch Arabic Notification Support](/images/top-smartwatches-under-299-sar/images/img-001.png)\n\n## 1. Kieslect Kr Pro: The AMOLED Beauty\n\n**Approx. Price:** 269 SAR\n\nIf the screen is your priority, the Kieslect Kr Pro is the winner. It features a stunning \"Always-On\" AMOLED display that looks far more expensive than it is. The colors pop, and the brightness allows for easy reading outdoors.\n\n*   **Best Feature:** Stable Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity for clear calls.\n*   **Battery:** 7 days of normal use.\n*   **Design:** Comes with two straps in the box (magnetic and silicone), which is a nice touch for switching between \"Office\" and \"Gym\" looks.\n\n## 2. Haylou Solar Plus RT3: The Battery Champion\n**Approx. Price:** 189 SAR\n\nHaylou (a Xiaomi ecosystem partner) is known for insane battery life. The Solar Plus RT3 retains the classic round watch look and is incredibly lightweight.\n\n*   **Best Feature:** Bluetooth phone calls at a sub-200 SAR price point.\n*   **Battery:** Can easily push 10-14 days on a single charge.\n*   **Durability:** IP68 water resistance, meaning it handles sweat and Wudu splashes perfectly fine.\n\n## 3. Redmi Watch 3 Active: The Reliable Essentials\n**Approx. Price:** 179 SAR\n\nYou can't talk budget tech without mentioning Xiaomi. The Redmi Watch 3 Active is the \"safe\" choice. It doesn't have the flashiest design, but the software is rock solid.\n\n*   **Best Feature:** Integration with Mi Fitness app is seamless.\n*   **Screen:** Large 1.83\" LCD display (not AMOLED, but very bright).\n*   **Calls:** Supports Bluetooth calls with a surprisingly good microphone.\n\n## 4. Amazfit Bip 3 Pro: The GPS Specialist\n**Approx. Price:** 249 SAR\n\nMost budget watches rely on your phone for GPS. The Amazfit Bip 3 Pro has **built-in GPS**. This is huge for runners who want to leave their hefty phones at home while jogging in parks or on the corniche.\n\n*   **Best Feature:** Standalone GPS tracking.\n*   **Battery:** up to 14 days.\n*   **Style:** Very similar rectangular design to the Apple Watch.\n\n## 5. Noise ColorFit Pro 4: The Stylish Newcomer\n**Approx. Price:** 199 SAR\n\nNoise is a newer brand gaining traction in the Gulf. The ColorFit Pro 4 stands out because of its smooth 60Hz display refresh rate, making the interface feel buttery smooth compared to the choppy menus of other cheap watches.\n\n*   **Best Feature:** Digital Crown navigation (scroll wheel) actually works.\n*   **Design:** Very trendy, with many colorful strap options available online.\n\n## Summary: Which One Should You Buy?\n\n*   **For the Best Screen:** Get the **Kieslect Kr Pro**.\n*   **For Runners:** Get the **Amazfit Bip 3 Pro**.\n*   **For Battery Life:** Get the **Haylou Solar Plus RT3**.\n*   **For Value:** Get the **Redmi Watch 3 Active**.\n\n## Where to Buy?\nYou can find these models at **Jarir**, **Extra**, or online via **Amazon.sa** and **Noon**. Always double-check for the \"Global Version\" to ensure full Arabic language support.",
