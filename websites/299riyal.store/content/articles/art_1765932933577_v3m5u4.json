We've tested the top models available in KSA to help you choose the right one.\n\n## Quick Picks: Top 3 Chargers\n\n| Model | **Anker PowerCore Essential** | **Xiaomi 22.5W Power Bank** | **RAVPower 20000mAh** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Best For** | Overall Value | Portability | Durability |\n| **Capacity** | 20,000mAh | 10,000mAh | 20,000mAh |\n| **Output** | 20W PD | 22.5W | 18W PD + QC |\n| **Ports** | USB-C + USB-A | USB-C + 2x USB-A | USB-C + USB-A |\n| **Price** | **199 SAR** | **79 SAR** | **149 SAR** |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Anker PowerCore Essential 20000 PD\n**The Gold Standard**\n\n*Approximate Price: 199 SAR*\n\n**Anker** is the undisputed king of charging technology. The **PowerCore Essential 20000 PD** combines massive capacity with decent portability. It features a textured exterior that resists scratches and feels premium in hand.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **Massive Capacity:** 20,000mAh is enough to charge an iPhone 15 roughly 4-5 times or a Samsung Galaxy S24 about 3.5 times.\n*   **Power Delivery (PD):** Charges your iPhone to 50% in just 30 minutes via the USB-C port.\n*   **Trickle Charging Mode:** A special mode for low-power devices like earbuds or smartwatches to prevent overcharging.\n\n### Expert Tip\nUse a high-quality Anker or Apple USB-C to Lightning cable to get the full 20W speed. Cheap cables will bottleneck the power bank.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Xiaomi 22.5W Power Bank 10000mAh\n**The Pocket Rocket**\n\n*Approximate Price: 79 SAR*\n\nIf you hate carrying a brick, the **Xiaomi 22.5W** is your best friend. It’s significantly smaller than the Anker but still packs enough punch to charge your phone for a full weekend trip.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **22.5W Fast Charging:** Surprisingly faster than many expensive competitors.\n*   **Metal Build:** The aluminum alloy case feels incredibly premium and dissipates heat well.\n*   **Dual Input/Output:** You can charge the power bank via USB-C or Micro-USB, giving you flexibility.\n\n**Verdict:** For under 80 SAR, this is the best value tech accessory you can buy in Saudi Arabia, period.\n\n---\n\n## 3. RAVPower 20000mAh 18W PD\n**The Reliable Workhorse**\n\n*Approximate Price: 149 SAR*\n\nRAVPower offers a rugged alternative to Anker. This unit is built to last and handles heat extremely well thanks to its iSmart technology.\n\n### Why Buy It?\n*   **iSmart Protection:** Intelligently detects the connected device and delivers the optimal current, protecting your phone's battery health.\n*   **Pass-Through Charging:** You can charge the power bank while it charges your phone (great for hotel rooms with one plug).\n*   **Airline Safe:** Fully compliant with airline regulations for carry-on luggage.\n\n---\n\n## Buying Guide: How to Choose a Power Bank\n\n### 1. Capacity (mAh)\n*   **10,000mAh:** Good for 1-2 full phone charges. Best for daily carry in a pocket or purse.\n*   **20,000mAh:** Good for 4-5 charges. Best for travel, camping, or heavy users. Not pocket-friendly.\n\n### 2. Charging Speed (PD vs. QC)\n*   **PD (Power Delivery):** Essential for iPhone fast charging (via USB-C). Look for at least 18W or 20W.\n*   **QC (Quick Charge):** Essential for Android devices for efficient charging.\n\n### 3. Ports\n*   **Input:** How you charge the power bank itself. Make sure it has **USB-C Input**. Older Micro-USB inputs take 10+ hours to recharge a 20k battery!\n*   **Output:** USB-C output is superior to USB-A output for modern phones.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Can I take these on a plane?\nYes. Airlines generally allow power banks under **27,000mAh (100Wh)** in your **carry-on luggage**. You **cannot** put them in checked baggage. All power banks on our list are safe for flights (Saudi Airlines, Flynas, etc.).\n\n### Does it come with a cable?\nMost power banks include a short cable for charging the power bank itself (usually USB-A to USB-C). They rarely include the cable to charge your specific phone (Lighting or long USB-C), so you'll need to use your own.\n\n### Will it damage my phone battery?\nNo, as long as you buy reputable brands like Anker, Xiaomi, or RAVPower. These have overcharge protection. Avoid cheap, unbranded power banks found in gas stations.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n*   **For the best all-rounder:** Buy the **[Anker PowerCore Essential 20000](#)**. It’s reliable, safe, and powerful.\n*   **For portability:** Buy the **[Xiaomi 22.5W](#)**.
